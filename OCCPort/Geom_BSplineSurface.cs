	//! Describes a BSpline surface.
	//! In each parametric direction, a BSpline surface can be:
	//! - uniform or non-uniform,
	//! - rational or non-rational,
	//! - periodic or non-periodic.
	//! A BSpline surface is defined by:
	//! - its degrees, in the u and v parametric directions,
	//! - its periodic characteristic, in the u and v parametric directions,
	//! - a table of poles, also called control points (together
	//! with the associated weights if the surface is rational), and
	//! - a table of knots, together with the associated multiplicities.
	//! The degree of a Geom_BSplineSurface is limited to
	//! a value (25) which is defined and controlled by the
	//! system. This value is returned by the function MaxDegree.
	//! Poles and Weights
	//! Poles and Weights are manipulated using two associative double arrays:
	//! - the poles table, which is a double array of gp_Pnt points, and
	//! - the weights table, which is a double array of reals.
	//! The bounds of the poles and weights arrays are:
	//! - 1 and NbUPoles for the row bounds (provided
	//! that the BSpline surface is not periodic in the u
	//! parametric direction), where NbUPoles is the
	//! number of poles of the surface in the u parametric direction, and
	//! - 1 and NbVPoles for the column bounds (provided
	//! that the BSpline surface is not periodic in the v
	//! parametric direction), where NbVPoles is the
	//! number of poles of the surface in the v parametric direction.
	//! The poles of the surface are the points used to shape
	//! and reshape the surface. They comprise a rectangular network.
	//! If the surface is not periodic:
	//! - The points (1, 1), (NbUPoles, 1), (1,
	//! NbVPoles), and (NbUPoles, NbVPoles)
	//! are the four parametric "corners" of the surface.
	//! - The first column of poles and the last column of
	//! poles define two BSpline curves which delimit the
	//! surface in the v parametric direction. These are the
	//! v isoparametric curves corresponding to the two
	//! bounds of the v parameter.
	//! - The first row of poles and the last row of poles
	//! define two BSpline curves which delimit the surface
	//! in the u parametric direction. These are the u
	//! isoparametric curves corresponding to the two bounds of the u parameter.
	//! If the surface is periodic, these geometric properties are not verified.
	//! It is more difficult to define a geometrical significance
	//! for the weights. However they are useful for
	//! representing a quadric surface precisely. Moreover, if
	//! the weights of all the poles are equal, the surface has
	//! a polynomial equation, and hence is a "non-rational surface".
	//! The non-rational surface is a special, but frequently
	//! used, case, where all poles have identical weights.
	//! The weights are defined and used only in the case of
	//! a rational surface. The rational characteristic is
	//! defined in each parametric direction. A surface can be
	//! rational in the u parametric direction, and
	//! non-rational in the v parametric direction.
	//! Knots and Multiplicities
	//! For a Geom_BSplineSurface the table of knots is
	//! made up of two increasing sequences of reals, without
	//! repetition, one for each parametric direction. The
	//! multiplicities define the repetition of the knots.
	//! A BSpline surface comprises multiple contiguous
	//! patches, which are themselves polynomial or rational
	//! surfaces. The knots are the parameters of the
	//! isoparametric curves which limit these contiguous
	//! patches. The multiplicity of a knot on a BSpline
	//! surface (in a given parametric direction) is related to
	//! the degree of continuity of the surface at that knot in
	//! that parametric direction:
	//! Degree of continuity at knot(i) = Degree - Multi(i) where:
	//! - Degree is the degree of the BSpline surface in
	//! the given parametric direction, and
	//! - Multi(i) is the multiplicity of knot number i in
	//! the given parametric direction.
	//! There are some special cases, where the knots are
	//! regularly spaced in one parametric direction (i.e. the
	//! difference between two consecutive knots is a constant).
	//! - "Uniform": all the multiplicities are equal to 1.
	//! - "Quasi-uniform": all the multiplicities are equal to 1,
	//! except for the first and last knots in this parametric
	//! direction, and these are equal to Degree + 1.
	//! - "Piecewise Bezier": all the multiplicities are equal to
	//! Degree except for the first and last knots, which
	//! are equal to Degree + 1. This surface is a
	//! concatenation of Bezier patches in the given
	//! parametric direction.
	//! If the BSpline surface is not periodic in a given
	//! parametric direction, the bounds of the knots and
	//! multiplicities tables are 1 and NbKnots, where
	//! NbKnots is the number of knots of the BSpline
	//! surface in that parametric direction.
	//! If the BSpline surface is periodic in a given parametric
	//! direction, and there are k periodic knots and p
	//! periodic poles in that parametric direction:
	//! - the period is such that:
	//! period = Knot(k+1) - Knot(1), and
	//! - the poles and knots tables in that parametric
	//! direction can be considered as infinite tables, such that:
	//! Knot(i+k) = Knot(i) + period, and
	//! Pole(i+p) = Pole(i)
	//! Note: The data structure tables for a periodic BSpline
	//! surface are more complex than those of a non-periodic one.

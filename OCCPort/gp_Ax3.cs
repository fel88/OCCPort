{
    //! Describes a coordinate system in 3D space. Unlike a
    //! gp_Ax2 coordinate system, a gp_Ax3 can be
    //! right-handed ("direct sense") or left-handed ("indirect sense").
    //! A coordinate system is defined by:
    //! -   its origin (also referred to as its "Location point"), and
    //! -   three orthogonal unit vectors, termed the "X
    //! Direction", the "Y Direction" and the "Direction" (also
    //! referred to as the "main Direction").
    //! The "Direction" of the coordinate system is called its
    //! "main Direction" because whenever this unit vector is
    //! modified, the "X Direction" and the "Y Direction" are
    //! recomputed. However, when we modify either the "X
    //! Direction" or the "Y Direction", "Direction" is not modified.
    //! "Direction" is also the "Z Direction".
    //! The "main Direction" is always parallel to the cross
    //! product of its "X Direction" and "Y Direction".
    //! If the coordinate system is right-handed, it satisfies the equation:
    //! "main Direction" = "X Direction" ^ "Y Direction"
    //! and if it is left-handed, it satisfies the equation:
    //! "main Direction" = -"X Direction" ^ "Y Direction"
    //! A coordinate system is used:
    //! -   to describe geometric entities, in particular to position
    //! them. The local coordinate system of a geometric
    //! entity serves the same purpose as the STEP function
    //! "axis placement three axes", or
    //! -   to define geometric transformations.
    //! Note:
    //! -   We refer to the "X Axis", "Y Axis" and "Z Axis",
    //! respectively, as the axes having:
    //! -   the origin of the coordinate system as their origin, and
    //! -   the unit vectors "X Direction", "Y Direction" and
    //! "main Direction", respectively, as their unit vectors.
    //! -   The "Z Axis" is also the "main Axis".
    //! -   gp_Ax2 is used to define a coordinate system that must be always right-handed.

+	//! Describes an axis in 3D space.
+	//! An axis is defined by:
+	//! -   its origin (also referred to as its "Location point"), and
+	//! -   its unit vector (referred to as its "Direction" or "main   Direction").
+	//! An axis is used:
+	//! -   to describe 3D geometric entities (for example, the
+	//! axis of a revolution entity). It serves the same purpose
+	//! as the STEP function "axis placement one axis", or
+	//! -   to define geometric transformations (axis of
+	//! symmetry, axis of rotation, and so on).
+	//! For example, this entity can be used to locate a geometric entity
+	//! or to define a symmetry axis.
